# Investment-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Power-BI
The project involved extensive use of Power BI to analyze and visualize various datasets. The process began with importing datasets into Power BI and conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and data types. Key statistics such as average age, investment percentages, and common savings objectives were computed and visualized for effective summary representation. Charts were developed to compare investment choices, including equity, mutual funds, and government bonds, based on gender, with significant gender-based trends highlighted. Correlations between savings objectives (e.g., Capital Appreciation) and investment avenues (e.g., Equity) were explored, and charts displaying preferred investment choices for each objective were generated. The project also included visualizing the distribution of investment durations and examining the impact of investment monitoring frequencies on preferences. Common trends in reasons for investment, such as Better Returns and Tax Benefits, were identified and visualized. Additionally, sources from which individuals gather investment information, such as Newspapers and the Internet, were analyzed and visualized. The project culminated in designing an intuitive Power BI dashboard that incorporated all previous analyses, included interactive elements for further data exploration, summarized major insights, and was polished for a professional and user-friendly experience.
